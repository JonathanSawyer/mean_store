# MEAN store
A simple web store built on the MEAN stack to study best practices with MEAN development.

## Building
To run the server you will need to have Node.js + NPM + Bower installed, as well as have a MongoDB available.

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install the dependencies.

Then you can run `node .` to start the server.

## Testing
To run all tests, run `gulp test`.

`gulp auto-test` paired with another window running `gulp auto-deploy` will automatically build and validate files.
